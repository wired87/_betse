# Default BETSE simulation configuration file.
#
# The following settings can be changed to customize simulations in BETSE. When
# editing the file, note that it is essential that the line indentations (tabs)
# are maintained in their current order, and that only variable assignments are
# changed. Variable names must not be changed. Comments are prefixed by "#" and
# may be altered.
#
# Note that each BETSE simulation requires an initialization run. The
# initialization is required to ensure that a simulation begins with a system in
# a steady state. Each subsequent simulation depends on an initialization run
# specific to the cell geometry and initialized parameters.
#
# Pathnames
# ----------
# For portability, files and directories are configured below as relative rather
# than absolute pathnames (e.g., as "sim_init.betse" rather than
# "/Users/iamawesome/my_sim/sim_init.betse"). Such pathnames are relative to the
# directory containing this file. This allows the directory to be safely moved
# without breaking existing tissue simulations.
#
# A Note on YAML
# ----------
# This file is formatted according to the YAML ([Y]AML [A]in't [M]arkup
# [L]anguage) standard. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format
# useful for configuration files -- like this one. For details, please see
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML.

# SOLVER SETTINGS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Settings specific to simulation solvers (i.e., numerical techniques internally employed by
# BETSE to iteratively compute each time step of this simulation).

solver options:
  type: full # Type of solver to enable for this simulation, as any following string:
             # * "full", a complete but slower solver producing publication-quality results
             #   by comprehensively simulating all possible bioelectrical phenomena.
             # * "fast", an incomplete but faster solver producing draft-quality results
             #   by the well-known equivalent circuit formalism analogizing biological
             #   systems to electronic circuits. While integrated with gene regulatory
             #   networks (GRNs), this solver *CANNOT* simulate:
             #   * Bioelectric fields or currents.
             #   * Extracellular voltages or voltage polarities.
             #   * Ion concentrations.
             #   These phenomena are silently ignored when this solver is enabled.

# WORLD OPTIONS
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# centres of cells are defined by 'circle' objects in the 'cells from svg' file. The fill color of
# the circular cell centerpoints can be used to assign cells to a specific tissue profile using the
# hex "color" type in the "Tissue Profiles" section below. When preparing the cell svg file, do not:
#
# * Use transforms (e.g. flip, rotate).
# * Group cells.

# TISSUE PROFILE DESIGNATION
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tissue profiles are user-defined regions within the cluster to which specific base membrane
# diffusion profiles, interventions, and individualized dynamics (e.g., voltage gated channels) can
# be applied. Tissue profiles can be gap-junction connected or separated (isolated) from other
# tissue profiles. Cluster shape and individual tissues can be defined by images, or specified via
# various functional regimes. When multiple profiles apply to the same cell, options defined by
# later profiles override options defined by earlier profiles.
#
# Raster image masks defining tissue and cut profiles *MUST*:
#
# * Be square (i.e., have equal width and height).
# * Contain no alpha transparency layer.
# * Contain pure-black pixels (i.e., pixels whose RGB color components are all 0) defining
#   the interior shape of that profile. All other pixels are ignored.
#
# No File synch issues: Tissue profiles can be altered after the time of the 'betse seed' command.
