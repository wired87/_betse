# This simulation features a small circular cluster of cells simulating numerous interventions (
# e.g. Na+ channel opening, K+ channel opening, H,K-ATPase transporter activation,
# Na,K-ATPase inhibtion, K+ extracellular) for 5 minute periods to show the effect of
# these activities on reversal potentials.  

# This config file represents a number of examples for how to
# do things like change the K+ level of the environment, 
# dynamically change concentrations of custom substances at the environment, 
# and define and work with your own custom ion pumps/transporters and channels. 

# Here is the sequence of manipulations during the sim:
# 60 -120 seconds, drug 'X' is added to the environment and blocks a K+ leak channel, cells depolarize 
# 240 -300 seconds, drug 'Y', a Na+ channel agonist, is added to the environment, cells depolarize
# 420 - 480 seconds, the Na/K-ATPase pump is blocked by addition of ouabain, cells depolarize a wee bit
# 600 - 660 seconds, cAMP is added to the environment, which activates an H,K-ATPase pump, cell pH increases
# 780-840 seconds, a potassium salt, K+/M- is added to the environment, cells depolarize

# all "drugs" are added to the environment by transiently changing the environmental boundary
# condition

# TISSUE PROFILE DESIGNATION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tissue profiles are user-defined regions within the cluster to which specific base
# membrane diffusion profiles, interventions, and individualized dynamics (e.g., voltage
# gated channels) can be applied. Tissue profiles can be gap-junction connected or
# separated (isolated) from other tissue profiles. Cluster shape and individual tissues
# can be defined by images, or specified via various functional regimes. When multiple
# profiles apply to the same cell, options defined by later profiles override options
# defined by earlier profiles.
#
# A profile's functionality is defined by the value of its "type" key:
#
# -> "type: tissue" associates profiled cells with the same parameters and events.
# -> "type: cut" permanently removes all cells at the begining of a sim run.
#    Cut profiles are ignored unless the cutting event defined below is also enabled.
#
# No File synch issues: Tissue profiles can be altered after the time of the 'betse seed' command.
#
# Image masks must have pure-black pixels (red, green, and blue color values all
# 0) defining the exterior shape of the entire cell cluster or tissue profile.
# Image masks *MUST*:
# * Be square (i.e., have equal width and height).
# * Contain no alpha transparency layer.

#  GENERAL NETWORK
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The "General Network" allows you to define a bioelectricity-integrated gene and reaction
# network with custom biomolecules, chemical reactions, channels, and transporters. Use this
# section to define general network main properties.  See "extra_config_template.yaml" in the
# "extra_configs" directory for examples.
#
# NOTE: The "optimization" is *not* required to run a general network; this is a tool that
# supplies you with a list of membrane diffusion constants and reaction/transporter maximum
# rate constants that are a "best fit" match to the target Vmem and initial concentrations
# listed for the "custom biomolecules" section of the network.
