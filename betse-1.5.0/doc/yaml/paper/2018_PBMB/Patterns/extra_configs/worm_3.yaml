# Model Bioelectric Gene and Regulatory (BIGR) network file that produces a range of categorically 
# different Vmem patterns on a medium-sized cell
# cluster. This model and config file were created by Alexis Pietak, and results 
# from this model are presented in:
# Pietak and Levin. Bioelectrical control of positional information in development 
# and regeneration: A review of conceptual and computational advances. Progress in Biophysics and
# Molecular Biology. 2018. 137:52-68.
# Please cite and discuss the above article if you have used/adapted this model/config file in your work.   

# To obtain different patterns, there are only a small number of "master" variables that alter pattern,
# importantly, many of these are in the extra_configs/worm_3.yaml file included with this simulation
# package. Different parameters that are worthy of being altered are marked by a '@' symbol, with
# a useful range given. 

# Note: There is no real need to run the "sim" phase for these -- the system is set up so that it should 
# form a pattern using only the 'init' phase command.

# GENE REGULATORY NETWORK DEFINITION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Mini-simulations of biochemical substances that can electrodiffuse across cell membranes, between cells via GJ, or
# in the environment. Also can be produced/consumed in the cytoplasm, act as gating ligand for a specific channel,
# be actively pumped in or out of cells, changed at the boundary, or plotted/animated at the end of the simulation.
