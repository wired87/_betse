# Please cite and discuss the above article if you have used/adapted this model/config file in your work.   

# To obtain different patterns, there are only a small number of "master" variables that alter pattern,
# importantly, many of these are in the extra_configs/worm_3.yaml file included with this simulation
# package. Different parameters that are worthy of being altered are marked by a '@' symbol, with
# a useful range given. 

# Note: There is no real need to run the "sim" phase for these -- the system is set up so that it should 
# form a pattern using only the 'init' phase command.

# TISSUE PROFILE DESIGNATION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tissue profiles are user-defined regions within the cluster to which specific base
# membrane diffusion profiles, interventions, and individualized dynamics (e.g., voltage
# gated channels) can be applied. Tissue profiles can be gap-junction connected or
# separated (isolated) from other tissue profiles. Cluster shape and individual tissues
# can be defined by images, or specified via various functional regimes. When multiple
# profiles apply to the same cell, options defined by later profiles override options
# defined by earlier profiles.
#
# A profile's functionality is defined by the value of its "type" key:
#
# -> "type: tissue" associates profiled cells with the same parameters and events.
# -> "type: cut" permanently removes all cells at the begining of a sim run.
#    Cut profiles are ignored unless the cutting event defined below is also enabled.
#
# No File synch issues: Tissue profiles can be altered after the time of the 'betse seed' command.
#
# Image masks must have pure-black pixels (red, green, and blue color values all
# 0) defining the exterior shape of the entire cell cluster or tissue profile.
# Image masks *MUST*:
# * Be square (i.e., have equal width and height).
# * Contain no alpha transparency layer.

#  GENERAL NETWORK
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The "General Network" allows you to define a bioelectricity-integrated gene and reaction
# network with custom biomolecules, chemical reactions, channels, and transporters. Use this
# section to define general network main properties.  See "extra_config_template.yaml" in the
# "extra_configs" directory for examples.
#
# NOTE: The "optimization" is *not* required to run a general network; this is a tool that
# supplies you with a list of membrane diffusion constants and reaction/transporter maximum
# rate constants that are a "best fit" match to the target Vmem and initial concentrations
# listed for the "custom biomolecules" section of the network.
