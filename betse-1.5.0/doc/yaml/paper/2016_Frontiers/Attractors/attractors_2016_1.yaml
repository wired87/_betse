# This simulation demonstrates how physiological Vmem and ion concentrations develop as "attractors"
# of the bioelectrochemical system: even if the system starts with equal ion concentrations inside and
# out of the cell, it will pump down to physiologically-relevant levels when it reaches steady-state.

# Here a small circular cluster of cells with the initial condition of equal ion 
# concentrations in the cells and environment starts at time zero. This replicates the 
# simulation shown in Figure 5:

#Pietak and Levin. Exploring Instructive Physiological Signaling with the Bioelectric Tissue Simulation

# but using the new version (v1.0) of BETSE.  

# In this simulation, gap junctions are blocked to generate electrically uncoupled cells.
# As the v1.0 version of BETSE uses an anion to charge compensate net charge to zero at time
# zero, this simulation requires protein levels to be much lower than those used in the paper referenced
# above. 
# This simulation also contains a bicarbonate buffer reaction to demonstrate how acid-base handling
# is accomplished in BETSE.

# TISSUE PROFILE DESIGNATION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tissue profiles are user-defined regions within the cluster to which specific base
# membrane diffusion profiles, interventions, and individualized dynamics (e.g., voltage
# gated channels) can be applied. Tissue profiles can be gap-junction connected or
# separated (isolated) from other tissue profiles. Cluster shape and individual tissues
# can be defined by images, or specified via various functional regimes. When multiple
# profiles apply to the same cell, options defined by later profiles override options
# defined by earlier profiles.
#
# A profile's functionality is defined by the value of its "type" key:
#
# -> "type: tissue" associates profiled cells with the same parameters and events.
# -> "type: cut" permanently removes all cells at the begining of a sim run.
#    Cut profiles are ignored unless the cutting event defined below is also enabled.
#
# No File synch issues: Tissue profiles can be altered after the time of the 'betse seed' command.
#
# Image masks must have pure-black pixels (red, green, and blue color values all
# 0) defining the exterior shape of the entire cell cluster or tissue profile.
# Image masks *MUST*:
# * Be square (i.e., have equal width and height).
# * Contain no alpha transparency layer.
