'''
Low-level **request** (i.e., the standard ``request`` fixture exposed by the
:mod:`pytest` API) functionality.

This submodule principally defines utility functions simplifying access to this
fixture. The official documentation for this fixture is blatantly inadequate.
Even were that *not* the case, however, this fixture's API is overly obtuse to
an absurd (and almost obfuscatory) degree. This submodule defines an
intelligible alternative to those horrors.

Caveats
-------
All functions defined below accepting a ``request`` fixture object assume the
passed object to be of the desired type rather than validating this to be the
case. Why? Because that type resides in a private module that does *not*
appear to be externally importable, thanks to devilish import trickery: e.g.,

    >>> import _pytest.python.FixtureRequest as req
    ImportError: cannot import name 'transfer_markers'
