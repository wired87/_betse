# This expression_data.yaml file allows for specific expression levels of any biomolecule, reaction, 
# channel, or transporter to be set across all tissue profiles of the model. Expression levels 
# are relative to the maximum:
# production rate (for biomolecules)
# reaction rate (for reactions)
# conductivity (for channels)
# rate (for transporters)
# Use the expression data 

K_Leak:   # Name of the biomolecule, pump, channel, reaction, or transporter in your main config file
  spot: 2.5  # Expression level on tissue profile 'spot'
  zone: 1.0 # Expression level on tissue profile 'zone'

Kv: # Name of the biomolecule, pump, channel, reaction, or transporter in your main config file
  spot: 2.5
  zone: 1.0

Nav: # Name of the biomolecule, pump, channel, reaction, or transporter in your main config file
